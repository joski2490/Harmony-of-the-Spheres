It is located 152.06 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>HD 24040 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 24040 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HD 24040 b</h1>\n      <p>HD 24040 b was discovered by the W. M. Keck Observatory observatory, in 2007-03, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 4.92 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 24040 b is 1227.480 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 24040 b is 13.000 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 24040 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n","type":"Exoplanets","forAllMankind":null,"scenarioWikiUrl":null,"playing":false,"isLoaded":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","dt":0.000005,"tol":0.0001,"sizeAttenuation":null,"mapMode":true,"displayGrid":null,"scale":2100000,"initTab":null,"minDt":0.000001,"maxDt":0.001,"g":39.5,"softeningConstant":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"elapsedTime":0,"barycenter":false,"systemBarycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"HD 24040","barycenterMassTwo":"HD 24040","lagrangePoints":null,"lagrangeMassOne":null,"lagrangeMassTwo":null,"barycenterZ":30996000,"customCameraPosition":null,"collisions":false,"maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"discoveryFacility":"Radial Velocity","velMin":-5,"velMax":5,"tcmsData":null,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"massBeingModified":"Mars","trails":false,"labels":true,"massToAdd":null,"ringToAdd":null,"particleTiltX":null,"particleTiltY":null,"particleTiltZ":null,"particleNumber":null,"particleMinD":null,"particleMaxD":null,"habitableZone":false,"referenceOrbits":false,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":true,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"HD 24040","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","cameraPosition":"Free","isMassBeingAdded":false,"massTypeToAdd":null,"primary":"HD 24040","a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"trajectoryTarget":null,"trajectoryTargetArrival":null,"trajectoryDepartureVelocity":null,"trajectoryArrivalVelocity":null,"trajectoryRelativeTo":null,"trajectoryRendevouz":null,"soi":null,"particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"shapes":null},"masses":[{"name":"HD 24040","m":1.11,"x":null,"y":null,"z":null,"vx":null,"vy":null,"vz":null,"a":null,"e":null,"o":null,"i":null,"w":null,"massType":"star","radius":12697.674418604653,"bump":null,"luminosity":null,"color":null,"temperature":5802,"tilt":null,"spacecraft":null,"bumpScale":null,"clouds":null,"orbitalPeriod":null,"texture":null,"bodyType":null,"atmosphere":null,"exoplanet":null,"customCameraPosition":null},{"name":"HD 24040-b","m":0.003683598,"x":null,"y":null,"z":null,"vx":null,"vy":null,"vz":null,"a":4.92,"e":0.04,"o":0,"i":null,"w":67,"massType":null,"radius":1133.0232558139535,"bump":false,"luminosity":null,"color":"#1FB294","temperature":117.28949235347065,"tilt":null,"spacecraft":null,"bumpScale":null,"clouds":false,"orbitalPeriod":3668,"texture":"HD 24040-b","bodyType":null,"atmosphere":null,"exoplanet":true,"customCameraPosition":{"x":2,"y":2,"z":0}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"7c166a9d-f0ea-547f-80d8-1931ce6fb792","pageType":"simulator"}}}
