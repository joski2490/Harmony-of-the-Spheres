It is located 760.72 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 1.8 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>EPIC 246193072 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the EPIC 246193072 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>EPIC 246193072 b</h1>\n      <p>EPIC 246193072 b was discovered by the K2 observatory, in 2020-10, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.10 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of EPIC 246193072 b is 82.680 times the mass of Earth. The radius of EPIC 246193072 b is 8.676 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, EPIC 246193072 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n","type":"Exoplanets","forAllMankind":null,"scenarioWikiUrl":null,"playing":false,"isLoaded":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","dt":0.000005,"tol":0.0001,"sizeAttenuation":null,"mapMode":true,"displayGrid":null,"scale":2100000,"initTab":null,"minDt":0.000001,"maxDt":0.001,"g":39.5,"softeningConstant":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"elapsedTime":0,"barycenter":false,"systemBarycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"EPIC 246193072","barycenterMassTwo":"EPIC 246193072","lagrangePoints":null,"lagrangeMassOne":null,"lagrangeMassTwo":null,"barycenterZ":640080,"customCameraPosition":null,"collisions":false,"maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"discoveryFacility":"Transit","velMin":-5,"velMax":5,"tcmsData":null,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"massBeingModified":"Mars","trails":false,"labels":true,"massToAdd":null,"ringToAdd":null,"particleTiltX":null,"particleTiltY":null,"particleTiltZ":null,"particleNumber":null,"particleMinD":null,"particleMaxD":null,"habitableZone":false,"referenceOrbits":false,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":true,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"EPIC 246193072","cameraFocus":"EPIC 246193072-b","cameraPosition":"Free","isMassBeingAdded":false,"massTypeToAdd":null,"primary":"EPIC 246193072","a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"trajectoryTarget":null,"trajectoryTargetArrival":null,"trajectoryDepartureVelocity":null,"trajectoryArrivalVelocity":null,"trajectoryRelativeTo":null,"trajectoryRendevouz":null,"soi":null,"particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"shapes":null},"masses":[{"name":"EPIC 246193072","m":0.9,"x":null,"y":null,"z":null,"vx":null,"vy":null,"vz":null,"a":null,"e":null,"o":null,"i":null,"w":null,"massType":"star","radius":8009.302325581395,"bump":null,"luminosity":null,"color":null,"temperature":5282,"tilt":null,"spacecraft":null,"bumpScale":null,"clouds":null,"orbitalPeriod":null,"texture":null,"bodyType":null,"atmosphere":null,"exoplanet":null,"customCameraPosition":null},{"name":"EPIC 246193072-b","m":0.000248118,"x":null,"y":null,"z":null,"vx":null,"vy":null,"vz":null,"a":0.1016,"e":0.0697,"o":0,"i":null,"w":161,"massType":null,"radius":756.0000000000001,"bump":false,"luminosity":null,"color":"#858D99","temperature":650,"tilt":null,"spacecraft":null,"bumpScale":null,"clouds":false,"orbitalPeriod":12.4551225,"texture":"EPIC 246193072-b","bodyType":null,"atmosphere":null,"exoplanet":true,"customCameraPosition":{"x":2,"y":2,"z":0}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"f099f233-311a-5ceb-92f2-0d805f84e729","pageType":"simulator"}}}
