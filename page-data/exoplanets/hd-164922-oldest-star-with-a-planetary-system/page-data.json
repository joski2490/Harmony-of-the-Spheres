It is located 71.76 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 9.58 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>HD 164922 is known to have 3 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 164922 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HD 164922 b</h1>\n      <p>HD 164922 b was discovered by the W. M. Keck Observatory observatory, in 2006-07, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 2.16 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 164922 b is 116.060 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 164922 b is 13.300 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, HD 164922 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 164922 c</h1>\n      <p>HD 164922 c was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory, in 2016-10, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.34 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 164922 c is 13.006 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 164922 c is 3.660 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, HD 164922 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>HD 164922 d</h1>\n      <p>HD 164922 d was discovered by the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory observatory, in 2020-05, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.10 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 164922 d is 4.004 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 164922 d is 1.830 that of Earth.  At 4.004 Earth masses, HD 164922 d is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     </p>\n      <br/>\n\n","type":"Exoplanets","forAllMankind":null,"scenarioWikiUrl":null,"playing":false,"isLoaded":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","dt":0.000005,"tol":0.0001,"sizeAttenuation":null,"mapMode":true,"displayGrid":null,"scale":2100000,"initTab":null,"minDt":0.000001,"maxDt":0.001,"g":39.5,"softeningConstant":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"elapsedTime":0,"barycenter":false,"systemBarycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"HD 164922","barycenterMassTwo":"HD 164922","lagrangePoints":null,"lagrangeMassOne":null,"lagrangeMassTwo":null,"barycenterZ":13608000,"customCameraPosition":null,"collisions":false,"maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"discoveryFacility":"Radial Velocity","velMin":-5,"velMax":5,"tcmsData":null,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"massBeingModified":"Mars","trails":false,"labels":true,"massToAdd":null,"ringToAdd":null,"particleTiltX":null,"particleTiltY":null,"particleTiltZ":null,"particleNumber":null,"particleMinD":null,"particleMaxD":null,"habitableZone":false,"referenceOrbits":false,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":true,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"HD 164922","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","cameraPosition":"Free","isMassBeingAdded":false,"massTypeToAdd":null,"primary":"HD 164922","a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"trajectoryTarget":null,"trajectoryTargetArrival":null,"trajectoryDepartureVelocity":null,"trajectoryArrivalVelocity":null,"trajectoryRelativeTo":null,"trajectoryRendevouz":null,"soi":null,"particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"shapes":null},"masses":[{"name":"HD 164922","m":0.93,"x":null,"y":null,"z":null,"vx":null,"vy":null,"vz":null,"a":null,"e":null,"o":null,"i":null,"w":null,"massType":"star","radius":9279.06976744186,"bump":null,"luminosity":null,"color":null,"temperature":5390,"tilt":null,"spacecraft":null,"bumpScale":null,"clouds":null,"orbitalPeriod":null,"texture":null,"bodyType":null,"atmosphere":null,"exoplanet":null,"customCameraPosition":null},{"name":"HD 164922-d","m":0.000012014637000000001,"x":null,"y":null,"z":null,"vx":null,"vy":null,"vz":null,"a":0.103,"e":0.12,"o":0,"i":null,"w":-48,"massType":null,"radius":159.2093023255814,"bump":true,"luminosity":null,"color":"#A1A556","temperature":709.8932111568051,"tilt":null,"spacecraft":null,"bumpScale":null,"clouds":false,"orbitalPeriod":12.458,"texture":"HD 164922-d","bodyType":null,"atmosphere":null,"exoplanet":true,"customCameraPosition":{"x":2,"y":2,"z":0}},{"name":"HD 164922-c","m":0.000039030870000000004,"x":null,"y":null,"z":null,"vx":null,"vy":null,"vz":null,"a":0.341,"e":0.12,"o":0,"i":null,"w":-29,"massType":null,"radius":319.3953488372093,"bump":false,"luminosity":null,"color":"#723235","temperature":400,"tilt":null,"spacecraft":null,"bumpScale":null,"clouds":false,"orbitalPeriod":75.74,"texture":"HD 164922-c","bodyType":null,"atmosphere":null,"exoplanet":true,"customCameraPosition":{"x":2,"y":2,"z":0}},{"name":"HD 164922-b","m":0.00034829087100000006,"x":null,"y":null,"z":null,"vx":null,"vy":null,"vz":null,"a":2.16,"e":0.08,"o":0,"i":null,"w":116,"massType":null,"radius":1162.3255813953488,"bump":false,"luminosity":null,"color":"#9D4152","temperature":159,"tilt":null,"spacecraft":null,"bumpScale":null,"clouds":false,"orbitalPeriod":1207,"texture":"HD 164922-b","bodyType":null,"atmosphere":null,"exoplanet":true,"customCameraPosition":{"x":2,"y":2,"z":0}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"e567b9a1-7d0a-5378-8afa-24fd4cac1305","pageType":"simulator"}}}
