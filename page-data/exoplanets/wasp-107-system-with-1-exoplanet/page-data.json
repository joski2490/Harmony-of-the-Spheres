It is located 211.16 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 8.3 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>WASP-107 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the WASP-107 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>WASP-107 b</h1>\n      <p>WASP-107 b was discovered by the SuperWASP-South observatory, in 2017-08, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.06 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of WASP-107 b is 38.160 times the mass of Earth. The radius of WASP-107 b is 10.536 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, WASP-107 b is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n","type":"Exoplanets","forAllMankind":null,"scenarioWikiUrl":null,"playing":false,"isLoaded":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","dt":0.000005,"tol":0.0001,"sizeAttenuation":null,"mapMode":true,"displayGrid":null,"scale":2100000,"initTab":null,"minDt":0.000001,"maxDt":0.001,"g":39.5,"softeningConstant":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"elapsedTime":0,"barycenter":false,"systemBarycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"WASP-107","barycenterMassTwo":"WASP-107","lagrangePoints":null,"lagrangeMassOne":null,"lagrangeMassTwo":null,"barycenterZ":346500,"customCameraPosition":null,"collisions":false,"maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"discoveryFacility":"Transit","velMin":-5,"velMax":5,"tcmsData":null,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"massBeingModified":"Mars","trails":false,"labels":true,"massToAdd":null,"ringToAdd":null,"particleTiltX":null,"particleTiltY":null,"particleTiltZ":null,"particleNumber":null,"particleMinD":null,"particleMaxD":null,"habitableZone":false,"referenceOrbits":false,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":false,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"WASP-107","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","cameraPosition":"Free","isMassBeingAdded":false,"massTypeToAdd":null,"primary":"WASP-107","a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"trajectoryTarget":null,"trajectoryTargetArrival":null,"trajectoryDepartureVelocity":null,"trajectoryArrivalVelocity":null,"trajectoryRelativeTo":null,"trajectoryRendevouz":null,"soi":null,"particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"shapes":null},"masses":[{"name":"WASP-107","m":0.69,"x":null,"y":null,"z":null,"vx":null,"vy":null,"vz":null,"a":null,"e":null,"o":null,"i":null,"w":null,"massType":"star","radius":6446.511627906977,"bump":null,"luminosity":null,"color":null,"temperature":4430,"tilt":null,"spacecraft":null,"bumpScale":null,"clouds":null,"orbitalPeriod":null,"texture":null,"bodyType":null,"atmosphere":null,"exoplanet":null,"customCameraPosition":null},{"name":"WASP-107-b","m":0.000114516,"x":null,"y":null,"z":null,"vx":null,"vy":null,"vz":null,"a":0.055,"e":0,"o":0,"i":null,"w":189.8633122315942,"massType":null,"radius":918.1395348837209,"bump":false,"luminosity":null,"color":"#F2EFE3","temperature":770,"tilt":null,"spacecraft":null,"bumpScale":null,"clouds":false,"orbitalPeriod":5.72149,"texture":"WASP-107-b","bodyType":null,"atmosphere":null,"exoplanet":true,"customCameraPosition":{"x":2,"y":2,"z":0}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"c73908e8-f8da-51d7-bee8-c14210094ff7","pageType":"simulator"}}}
