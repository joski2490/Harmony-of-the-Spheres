It is located 34.64 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 1 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>L 98-59 is known to have 3 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the L 98-59 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>L 98-59 b</h1>\n      <p>L 98-59 b was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory, in 2019-07, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.02 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of L 98-59 b is 1.011 times the mass of Earth. The radius of L 98-59 b is 0.800 that of Earth. At less than 1.5 Earth masses, L 98-59 b is a regular terrestrial planet, much like the terrestrial planets we find in our solar system, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.      </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>L 98-59 c</h1>\n      <p>L 98-59 c was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory, in 2019-07, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.03 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of L 98-59 c is 2.420 times the mass of Earth. The radius of L 98-59 c is 1.350 that of Earth.  At 2.420 Earth masses, L 98-59 c is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>L 98-59 d</h1>\n      <p>L 98-59 d was discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observatory, in 2019-07, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.05 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of L 98-59 d is 2.312 times the mass of Earth. The radius of L 98-59 d is 1.570 that of Earth.   With a mass below 5 Earth masses, a density of 3.3, and a semi-major axis of 0.0506 astronomical units, L 98-59 d could, potentially, be an ocean world - a planet with no dry land.    </p>\n      <br/>\n\n","type":"Exoplanets","forAllMankind":null,"scenarioWikiUrl":null,"playing":false,"isLoaded":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","dt":0.000005,"tol":0.0001,"sizeAttenuation":null,"mapMode":true,"displayGrid":null,"scale":2100000,"initTab":null,"minDt":0.000001,"maxDt":0.001,"g":39.5,"softeningConstant":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"elapsedTime":0,"barycenter":false,"systemBarycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"L 98-59","barycenterMassTwo":"L 98-59","lagrangePoints":null,"lagrangeMassOne":null,"lagrangeMassTwo":null,"barycenterZ":318780,"customCameraPosition":null,"collisions":false,"maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"discoveryFacility":"Transit","velMin":-5,"velMax":5,"tcmsData":null,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"massBeingModified":"Mars","trails":false,"labels":true,"massToAdd":null,"ringToAdd":null,"particleTiltX":null,"particleTiltY":null,"particleTiltZ":null,"particleNumber":null,"particleMinD":null,"particleMaxD":null,"habitableZone":false,"referenceOrbits":false,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":true,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"L 98-59","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","cameraPosition":"Free","isMassBeingAdded":false,"massTypeToAdd":null,"primary":"L 98-59","a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"trajectoryTarget":null,"trajectoryTargetArrival":null,"trajectoryDepartureVelocity":null,"trajectoryArrivalVelocity":null,"trajectoryRelativeTo":null,"trajectoryRendevouz":null,"soi":null,"particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"shapes":null},"masses":[{"name":"L 98-59","m":0.31,"x":null,"y":null,"z":null,"vx":null,"vy":null,"vz":null,"a":null,"e":null,"o":null,"i":null,"w":null,"massType":"star","radius":3027.906976744186,"bump":null,"luminosity":null,"color":null,"temperature":3412,"tilt":null,"spacecraft":null,"bumpScale":null,"clouds":null,"orbitalPeriod":null,"texture":null,"bodyType":null,"atmosphere":null,"exoplanet":null,"customCameraPosition":null},{"name":"L 98-59-d","m":0.000006937761000000001,"x":null,"y":null,"z":null,"vx":null,"vy":null,"vz":null,"a":0.0506,"e":0.09,"o":0,"i":null,"w":40.1,"massType":null,"radius":136.74418604651166,"bump":true,"luminosity":null,"color":"#6B4D8F","temperature":409,"tilt":null,"spacecraft":null,"bumpScale":null,"clouds":true,"orbitalPeriod":7.4512,"texture":"L 98-59-d","bodyType":null,"atmosphere":null,"exoplanet":true,"customCameraPosition":{"x":2,"y":2,"z":0}},{"name":"L 98-59-c","m":0.000007262223,"x":null,"y":null,"z":null,"vx":null,"vy":null,"vz":null,"a":0.0317,"e":0.07,"o":0,"i":null,"w":-22.9,"massType":null,"radius":117.2093023255814,"bump":true,"luminosity":null,"color":"#3D5BDF","temperature":517,"tilt":null,"spacecraft":null,"bumpScale":null,"clouds":false,"orbitalPeriod":3.6904,"texture":"L 98-59-c","bodyType":null,"atmosphere":null,"exoplanet":true,"customCameraPosition":{"x":2,"y":2,"z":0}},{"name":"L 98-59-b","m":0.000003034674,"x":null,"y":null,"z":null,"vx":null,"vy":null,"vz":null,"a":0.02282,"e":0.12,"o":0,"i":null,"w":17.2,"massType":null,"radius":69.34883720930232,"bump":true,"luminosity":null,"color":"#097544","temperature":610,"tilt":null,"spacecraft":null,"bumpScale":null,"clouds":false,"orbitalPeriod":2.2531,"texture":"L 98-59-b","bodyType":null,"atmosphere":null,"exoplanet":true,"customCameraPosition":{"x":2,"y":2,"z":0}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"b4dd0cfb-09f9-5ac0-8fce-bce6828181b2","pageType":"simulator"}}}
