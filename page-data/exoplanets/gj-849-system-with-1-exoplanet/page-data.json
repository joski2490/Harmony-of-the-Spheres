It is located 28.70 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 3 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>GJ 849 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the GJ 849 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>GJ 849 b</h1>\n      <p>GJ 849 b was discovered by the W. M. Keck Observatory observatory, in 2006-12, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 2.35 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of GJ 849 b is 318.000 times the mass of Earth. The radius of GJ 849 b is 13.800 that of Earth.      At more than 50 Earth masses, GJ 849 b is a gas giant, a planet whose mass is mostly made up of hydrogen and helium, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. </p>\n      <br/>\n\n","type":"Exoplanets","forAllMankind":null,"scenarioWikiUrl":null,"playing":false,"isLoaded":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","dt":0.000005,"tol":0.0001,"sizeAttenuation":null,"mapMode":true,"displayGrid":null,"scale":2100000,"initTab":null,"minDt":0.000001,"maxDt":0.001,"g":39.5,"softeningConstant":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"elapsedTime":0,"barycenter":false,"systemBarycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"GJ 849","barycenterMassTwo":"GJ 849","lagrangePoints":null,"lagrangeMassOne":null,"lagrangeMassTwo":null,"barycenterZ":14805000,"customCameraPosition":null,"collisions":false,"maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"discoveryFacility":"Radial Velocity","velMin":-5,"velMax":5,"tcmsData":null,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"massBeingModified":"Mars","trails":false,"labels":true,"massToAdd":null,"ringToAdd":null,"particleTiltX":null,"particleTiltY":null,"particleTiltZ":null,"particleNumber":null,"particleMinD":null,"particleMaxD":null,"habitableZone":false,"referenceOrbits":false,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":true,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"GJ 849","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","cameraPosition":"Free","isMassBeingAdded":false,"massTypeToAdd":null,"primary":"GJ 849","a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"trajectoryTarget":null,"trajectoryTargetArrival":null,"trajectoryDepartureVelocity":null,"trajectoryArrivalVelocity":null,"trajectoryRelativeTo":null,"trajectoryRendevouz":null,"soi":null,"particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"shapes":null},"masses":[{"name":"GJ 849","m":0.65,"x":null,"y":null,"z":null,"vx":null,"vy":null,"vz":null,"a":null,"e":null,"o":null,"i":null,"w":null,"massType":"star","radius":5176.744186046512,"bump":null,"luminosity":null,"color":null,"temperature":3241,"tilt":null,"spacecraft":null,"bumpScale":null,"clouds":null,"orbitalPeriod":null,"texture":null,"bodyType":null,"atmosphere":null,"exoplanet":null,"customCameraPosition":null},{"name":"GJ 849-b","m":0.0009543,"x":null,"y":null,"z":null,"vx":null,"vy":null,"vz":null,"a":2.35,"e":0.04,"o":0,"i":null,"w":66,"massType":null,"radius":1201.3953488372094,"bump":false,"luminosity":null,"color":"#6AF718","temperature":113.60580155440822,"tilt":null,"spacecraft":null,"bumpScale":null,"clouds":false,"orbitalPeriod":1882,"texture":"GJ 849-b","bodyType":null,"atmosphere":null,"exoplanet":true,"customCameraPosition":{"x":2,"y":2,"z":0}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"c8733cac-3c62-51bf-a6b6-d8f06dbd7d69","pageType":"simulator"}}}
