It is located 946.91 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 2.14 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>Kepler-968 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the Kepler-968 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>Kepler-968 b</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-968 b was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2016-05, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.04 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-968 b is 4.675 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-968 b is 2.000 that of Earth.   With a mass below 5 Earth masses, a density of 3.2, and a semi-major axis of 0.0389 astronomical units, Kepler-968 b could, potentially, be an ocean world - a planet with no dry land.    </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>Kepler-968 c</h1>\n      <p>Kepler-968 c was discovered by the Kepler observatory, in 2016-05, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.05 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of Kepler-968 c is 3.498 times the mass of Earth. The radius of Kepler-968 c is 1.690 that of Earth.  At 3.498 Earth masses, Kepler-968 c is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     </p>\n      <br/>\n\n","type":"Exoplanets","forAllMankind":null,"scenarioWikiUrl":null,"playing":false,"isLoaded":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","dt":0.000005,"tol":0.0001,"sizeAttenuation":null,"mapMode":true,"displayGrid":null,"scale":2100000,"initTab":null,"minDt":0.000001,"maxDt":0.001,"g":39.5,"softeningConstant":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"elapsedTime":0,"barycenter":false,"systemBarycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"Kepler-968","barycenterMassTwo":"Kepler-968","lagrangePoints":null,"lagrangeMassOne":null,"lagrangeMassTwo":null,"barycenterZ":327600,"customCameraPosition":null,"collisions":false,"maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"discoveryFacility":"Transit","velMin":-5,"velMax":5,"tcmsData":null,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"massBeingModified":"Mars","trails":false,"labels":true,"massToAdd":null,"ringToAdd":null,"particleTiltX":null,"particleTiltY":null,"particleTiltZ":null,"particleNumber":null,"particleMinD":null,"particleMaxD":null,"habitableZone":false,"referenceOrbits":false,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":true,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"Kepler-968","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","cameraPosition":"Free","isMassBeingAdded":false,"massTypeToAdd":null,"primary":"Kepler-968","a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"trajectoryTarget":null,"trajectoryTargetArrival":null,"trajectoryDepartureVelocity":null,"trajectoryArrivalVelocity":null,"trajectoryRelativeTo":null,"trajectoryRendevouz":null,"soi":null,"particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"shapes":null},"masses":[{"name":"Kepler-968","m":0.76,"x":null,"y":null,"z":null,"vx":null,"vy":null,"vz":null,"a":null,"e":null,"o":null,"i":null,"w":null,"massType":"star","radius":6837.209302325581,"bump":null,"luminosity":null,"color":null,"temperature":4598,"tilt":null,"spacecraft":null,"bumpScale":null,"clouds":null,"orbitalPeriod":null,"texture":null,"bodyType":null,"atmosphere":null,"exoplanet":null,"customCameraPosition":null},{"name":"Kepler-968-c","m":0.0000104973,"x":null,"y":null,"z":null,"vx":null,"vy":null,"vz":null,"a":0.052,"e":0,"o":0,"i":null,"w":113.55718048382994,"massType":null,"radius":147.48837209302326,"bump":true,"luminosity":null,"color":"#F5873F","temperature":644,"tilt":null,"spacecraft":null,"bumpScale":null,"clouds":false,"orbitalPeriod":5.70940492,"texture":"Kepler-968-c","bodyType":null,"atmosphere":null,"exoplanet":true,"customCameraPosition":{"x":2,"y":2,"z":0}},{"name":"Kepler-968-b","m":0.00001402821,"x":null,"y":null,"z":null,"vx":null,"vy":null,"vz":null,"a":0.0389,"e":0,"o":0,"i":null,"w":270.550984751532,"massType":null,"radius":173.86046511627907,"bump":true,"luminosity":null,"color":"#858A8C","temperature":745,"tilt":null,"spacecraft":null,"bumpScale":null,"clouds":true,"orbitalPeriod":3.69298373,"texture":"Kepler-968-b","bodyType":null,"atmosphere":null,"exoplanet":true,"customCameraPosition":{"x":2,"y":2,"z":0}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"8a1a1025-a9f7-52ec-bb35-21e4d4b4ca91","pageType":"simulator"}}}
