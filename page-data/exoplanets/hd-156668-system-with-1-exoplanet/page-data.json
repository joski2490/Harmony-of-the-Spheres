It is located 79.36 light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 8.6 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>HD 156668 is known to have 1 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the HD 156668 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>HD 156668 b</h1>\n      <p>HD 156668 b was discovered by the W. M. Keck Observatory observatory, in 2011-01, using the radial velocity method. Its semi-major axis is 0.05 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of HD 156668 b is 4.134 times the mass of Earth. The radius of HD 156668 b is 1.870 that of Earth.   With a mass below 5 Earth masses, a density of 3.49, and a semi-major axis of 0.05 astronomical units, HD 156668 b could, potentially, be an ocean world - a planet with no dry land.    </p>\n      <br/>\n\n","type":"Exoplanets","forAllMankind":null,"scenarioWikiUrl":null,"playing":false,"isLoaded":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","dt":0.000005,"tol":0.0001,"sizeAttenuation":null,"mapMode":true,"displayGrid":null,"scale":2100000,"initTab":null,"minDt":0.000001,"maxDt":0.001,"g":39.5,"softeningConstant":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"elapsedTime":0,"barycenter":false,"systemBarycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"HD 156668","barycenterMassTwo":"HD 156668","lagrangePoints":null,"lagrangeMassOne":null,"lagrangeMassTwo":null,"barycenterZ":315000,"customCameraPosition":null,"collisions":false,"maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"discoveryFacility":"Radial Velocity","velMin":-5,"velMax":5,"tcmsData":null,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"massBeingModified":"Mars","trails":false,"labels":true,"massToAdd":null,"ringToAdd":null,"particleTiltX":null,"particleTiltY":null,"particleTiltZ":null,"particleNumber":null,"particleMinD":null,"particleMaxD":null,"habitableZone":false,"referenceOrbits":false,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":true,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"HD 156668","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","cameraPosition":"Free","isMassBeingAdded":false,"massTypeToAdd":null,"primary":"HD 156668","a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"trajectoryTarget":null,"trajectoryTargetArrival":null,"trajectoryDepartureVelocity":null,"trajectoryArrivalVelocity":null,"trajectoryRelativeTo":null,"trajectoryRendevouz":null,"soi":null,"particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"shapes":null},"masses":[{"name":"HD 156668","m":0.77,"x":null,"y":null,"z":null,"vx":null,"vy":null,"vz":null,"a":null,"e":null,"o":null,"i":null,"w":null,"massType":"star","radius":7032.558139534884,"bump":null,"luminosity":null,"color":null,"temperature":4850,"tilt":null,"spacecraft":null,"bumpScale":null,"clouds":null,"orbitalPeriod":null,"texture":null,"bodyType":null,"atmosphere":null,"exoplanet":null,"customCameraPosition":null},{"name":"HD 156668-b","m":0.0000124059,"x":null,"y":null,"z":null,"vx":null,"vy":null,"vz":null,"a":0.05,"e":0,"o":0,"i":null,"w":261.2306785005767,"massType":null,"radius":163.11627906976747,"bump":true,"luminosity":null,"color":"#8183CD","temperature":884.3668717433526,"tilt":null,"spacecraft":null,"bumpScale":null,"clouds":true,"orbitalPeriod":4.6455,"texture":"HD 156668-b","bodyType":null,"atmosphere":null,"exoplanet":true,"customCameraPosition":{"x":2,"y":2,"z":0}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"8f0c3f67-e8c3-5ef8-90eb-4b4276e5d23d","pageType":"simulator"}}}
