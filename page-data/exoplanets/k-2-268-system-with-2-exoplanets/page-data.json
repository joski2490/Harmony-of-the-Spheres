It is located 1069.08 light years away from the solar system.</p>\n<p>K2-268 is known to have 2 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the K2-268 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>K2-268 b</h1>\n      <p>K2-268 b was discovered by the K2 observatory, in 2018-12, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.03 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of K2-268 b is 2.573 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-268 b is 1.410 that of Earth.  At 2.573 Earth masses, K2-268 b is a so called Super Earth. Super Earths could be terrestrial worlds like Earth, but they could also be ocean worlds or terrestrial worlds wrapped in a substantial atmosphere, in which case some refer to them as Mini Neptunes. No Super Earths are known to exist in our solar system, but if it exists, the so-called Planet Nine could very well be a super Earth, as it is hypothesized to have a mass between five and ten Earth masses.     </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>K2-268 c</h1>\n      <p>K2-268 c was discovered by the K2 observatory, in 2018-12, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.08 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of K2-268 c is 7.696 times the mass of Earth. The radius of K2-268 c is 2.690 that of Earth.     At more than 10 Earth masses, K2-268 c is an ice giant, a planet that is made up mostly of volatiles like water, amonia and methane, and enveloped by a dense hydrogen and helium atmosphere, much like Uranus and Neptune in our solar system.  </p>\n      <br/>\n\n","type":"Exoplanets","forAllMankind":null,"scenarioWikiUrl":null,"playing":false,"isLoaded":false,"integrator":"PEFRL","dt":0.000005,"tol":0.0001,"sizeAttenuation":null,"mapMode":true,"displayGrid":null,"scale":2100000,"initTab":null,"minDt":0.000001,"maxDt":0.001,"g":39.5,"softeningConstant":0,"useBarnesHut":false,"theta":0.5,"elapsedTime":0,"barycenter":false,"systemBarycenter":true,"barycenterMassOne":"K2-268","barycenterMassTwo":"K2-268","lagrangePoints":null,"lagrangeMassOne":null,"lagrangeMassTwo":null,"barycenterZ":515970,"customCameraPosition":null,"collisions":false,"maximumDistance":{"name":"Phobos to Mars * 100","value":0.00626747},"distanceStep":{"name":"Phobos to Mars / 10","value":0.00000626747},"distMax":50,"distMin":-50,"discoveryFacility":"Transit","velMin":-5,"velMax":5,"tcmsData":null,"velStep":0.00000185765499287888,"massBeingModified":"Mars","trails":false,"labels":true,"massToAdd":null,"ringToAdd":null,"particleTiltX":null,"particleTiltY":null,"particleTiltZ":null,"particleNumber":null,"particleMinD":null,"particleMaxD":null,"habitableZone":false,"referenceOrbits":false,"logarithmicDepthBuffer":true,"rotatingReferenceFrame":"K2-268","cameraFocus":"Barycenter","cameraPosition":"Free","isMassBeingAdded":false,"massTypeToAdd":null,"primary":"K2-268","a":0,"e":0,"w":0,"i":0,"o":0,"trajectoryTarget":null,"trajectoryTargetArrival":null,"trajectoryDepartureVelocity":null,"trajectoryArrivalVelocity":null,"trajectoryRelativeTo":null,"trajectoryRendevouz":null,"soi":null,"particles":{"max":20000,"size":10,"shapes":null},"masses":[{"name":"K2-268","m":0.84,"x":null,"y":null,"z":null,"vx":null,"vy":null,"vz":null,"a":null,"e":null,"o":null,"i":null,"w":null,"massType":"star","radius":7618.604651162791,"bump":null,"luminosity":null,"color":null,"temperature":5068,"tilt":null,"spacecraft":null,"bumpScale":null,"clouds":null,"orbitalPeriod":null,"texture":null,"bodyType":null,"atmosphere":null,"exoplanet":null,"customCameraPosition":null},{"name":"K2-268-c","m":0.00002309406,"x":null,"y":null,"z":null,"vx":null,"vy":null,"vz":null,"a":0.0819,"e":0,"o":0,"i":null,"w":1.876778727815891,"massType":null,"radius":234.4186046511628,"bump":false,"luminosity":null,"color":"#49A269","temperature":688,"tilt":null,"spacecraft":null,"bumpScale":null,"clouds":false,"orbitalPeriod":9.326841,"texture":"K2-268-c","bodyType":null,"atmosphere":null,"exoplanet":true,"customCameraPosition":{"x":2,"y":2,"z":0}},{"name":"K2-268-b","m":0.000007720287,"x":null,"y":null,"z":null,"vx":null,"vy":null,"vz":null,"a":0.0308,"e":0,"o":0,"i":null,"w":106.44227207177907,"massType":null,"radius":123.06976744186048,"bump":true,"luminosity":null,"color":"#9A7432","temperature":1121,"tilt":null,"spacecraft":null,"bumpScale":null,"clouds":false,"orbitalPeriod":2.151894,"texture":"K2-268-b","bodyType":null,"atmosphere":null,"exoplanet":true,"customCameraPosition":{"x":2,"y":2,"z":0}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"3c27ca09-6561-5051-81f0-3660a183020c","pageType":"simulator"}}}
