It is located NaN light years away from the solar system and is estimated to be 0.5 billion years old, as compared to the Sun which is roughly 4.6 billion years old.</p>\n<p>TRAPPIST-1 is known to have 7 exoplanets in orbit around it.</p>\n\n<br/>\n  <h1>Exoplanets in the TRAPPIST-1 system</h1>\n  <br/>\n  \n      <h1>TRAPPIST-1 b</h1>\n      <p>TRAPPIST-1 b was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2016-05, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.01 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of TRAPPIST-1 b is 0.849 times the mass of Earth. The radius of TRAPPIST-1 b is 1.086 that of Earth. At less than 1.5 Earth masses, TRAPPIST-1 b is a regular terrestrial planet, much like the terrestrial planets we find in our solar system, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.      </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>TRAPPIST-1 c</h1>\n      <p>TRAPPIST-1 c was discovered by the La Silla Observatory observatory, in 2016-05, using the transit method.

The radius of TRAPPIST-1 e is 0.918 that of Earth. At less than 1.5 Earth masses, TRAPPIST-1 e is a regular terrestrial planet, much like the terrestrial planets we find in our solar system, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.      TRAPPIST-1 e orbits within the habitable zone of its parent star and could, potentially, be a habitable planet with stable bodies of liquid water on its surface, like Earth.</p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>TRAPPIST-1 f</h1>\n      <p>TRAPPIST-1 f was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory, in 2016-05, using the transit method.

The radius of TRAPPIST-1 f is 1.045 that of Earth.   With a mass below 5 Earth masses, a density of 3.3, and a semi-major axis of 0.0371 astronomical units, TRAPPIST-1 f could, potentially, be an ocean world - a planet with no dry land.    </p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>TRAPPIST-1 g</h1>\n      <p>TRAPPIST-1 g was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory, in 2016-05, using the transit method.

The radius of TRAPPIST-1 g is 1.127 that of Earth. At less than 1.5 Earth masses, TRAPPIST-1 g is a regular terrestrial planet, much like the terrestrial planets we find in our solar system, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.      TRAPPIST-1 g orbits within the habitable zone of its parent star and could, potentially, be a habitable planet with stable bodies of liquid water on its surface, like Earth.</p>\n      <br/>\n \n      <h1>TRAPPIST-1 h</h1>\n      <p>TRAPPIST-1 h was discovered by the Multiple Observatories observatory, in 2016-05, using the transit method. Its semi-major axis is 0.06 astronomical units, as compared to Earth's which is 1 astronomical unit. The mass of TRAPPIST-1 h is 0.331 times the mass of Earth. The radius of TRAPPIST-1 h is 0.752 that of Earth.    With a mass below 5 Earth masses, and a semi-major axis of 0.061935 astronomical units, which is outside the habitable zone of TRAPPIST-1, TRAPPIST-1 h is likely an icy world.   </p>\n
